## The CometD Dojo Bindings Repository

This repository is a copy of the
[CometD Dojo bindings](https://github.com/cometd/cometd/tree/master/cometd-javascript/dojo)
that you can find at the [master CometD repository](https://github.com/cometd/cometd).

While the master CometD repository packages the CometD Dojo bindings
in a format that is appropriate for Maven users and for users that
want to build Java web applications, this repository repackages the
CometD Dojo bindings in a format that is more convenient for non-Maven
users and for users that prefer to consume JavaScript source files,
for example with build tools.

This repository is synchronized with the master repository on every
CometD release.

or the [Apache 2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
